Coursera / Getting and Cleaning Data Course project

##run_analysis.R, script
This project is intended to demonstrate some skills on obtaining and cleaning data from raw data sets, as part of the Coursera Getting and cleaning data Course.

##Raw data.
The original data sets can be found on this URL: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip, at the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You´ll find some sets of .txt files which contains data about subjects performance and physiological variables obtained from those subjects through wearable gadgets connected to smartphones.

##Running run_analysis.R script
After downloading and unzip the data set, you should store the UCI .txt files on your working directory and overwrite the script to locate the files. Then you´ll be able to set the script setwd()command to your own working directory and run the script over the stored files.

#Instructions
The run_analysis.R script, will obtain a tidy data set from the UCI repository, this data set will reflect the average values over each and every variable, crossed with the user and the activity type recorded by the wearable gadgets and passed to the smartphones.

The tidy data set can be viewed after running the run_anaylisis.R script and finally run the: write.table(promedios, "promedios.txt", row.name=FALSE) instruction attached to the script.

##The script
Running the run_analysis.R script: 1.- Set working directory. In this part, setwd() will allow you to reach for the files unzipped and loaded to your working directory 2.-Load dplyr() and plyr(), packages that will be used to get rid of duplicated columns on data sets and allows to select desired columns on lines 41 and 42. 3.- Lines 8 and 9 read the text files containing labels for the final data set 4.- Lines 11 to 23 read the text files containing the values for each train and test values, and the subject and activities lists 5.- Lines 26 to 28 merges and combines the data sets uploaded to R into a single and coherent data frame 6.- Lines 33 to 35 Assign descriptive names to activities on data set, correct them and labels the data set with descriptive variables 7.- Line 38 creates the final complete tidy data set to work with 8.- Line 41 gets rid of duplicated columns to avoid them to interfere while extracting certain variables 9.- Line 42 uses select() function from dplyr() package to select and extract only the variables containing mean and std values from the tidy data set 10.- Finally, Using plyr, and write.table, create a .txt file with the tidy data set

##Warnings
This run_analysis.R script doesn´t follows the exact sequencial steps from the Course Project but complies with each and every steps required, in different order, to finally obtain the requested final tidy data set.

#Code Book
This code book summarizes the resulting data fields in promedios.txt.
